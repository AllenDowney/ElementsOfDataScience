So the answer to the original question is a clear yes: with a gamma distribution and sample sizes near 30, the sampling distribution of the mean is approximately normal, the assumptions of the t-test are satisfied, and the results are accurate enough for practical purpose.\n",

    "At least, for *these* gamma distributions that's true.  For other gamma distributions it might not be.  In particular, when the mean of a gamma distribution is small, its skewness is large, and we need a larger sample size to ensure that the sampling distribution is normal enough.\n",

But if we have to use resampling to know whether or not the t-test is reliable, we might as well use resampling to compute the p-value, standard error, and/or confidence interval, in my opinion."
