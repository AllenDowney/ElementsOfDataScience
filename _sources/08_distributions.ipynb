    "\n",
    "In this noteboook we'll see three ways to describe a set of values:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A probability mass function (PMF), which represents a set of values and the number of times each one appears in a dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "* A cumulative distribution function (CDF), which contains the same information as a PMF in a form that makes it easier to visualize, compare distributions, and perform some computations.\n",
    "\n",
    "* A kernel density estimate (KDE), which is like a smooth, continuous version of a histogram.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will also see ways to compare distributions and compare real data to a mathematical model.\n",
    "\n",
    "For examples, we'll use data from the General Social Survey (GSS) to look at distributions of age and income, and to explore the relationship between income and education."
