    "This notebook presents ways to create figures and graphs, more generally called \"data visualizations\".  As examples, we'll generate three figures:\n",
    "\n",
    "* We'll replicate a figure from the Pew Research Center that shows changes in religious affiliation in the U.S. over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "* We'll replicate the figure from *The Economist* that shows the prices of sandwiches in Boston and London (we saw this data back in Notebook 03).\n",
    "\n",
    "* We'll make a plot to test Zipf's law, which describes the relationship between word frequencies and their ranks.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the tools in this notebook, you can generate a variety of simple graphs.  We will see more visualization tools in later notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "But before we get started with plotting, we need a new language feature: keyword arguments."
