    "\n",
    "1. We started with results from a vaccine trial.  We estimated the effectiveness of the vaccine and used simulation to draw a random sample from the sampling distribution of effectiveness.  We used that sample to compute a standard error and a 90% confidence interval, which measure the variability we would expect if we ran the experiment again (assuming that the observed efficacy is correct).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. As a second example, we estimated the height of adult males in the U.S. and used simulation based on a normal model to compute the sampling distribution of the mean, standard error, and a confidence interval.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. We implemented a second model of the vaccine trial, based on the assumption that there is variation in risk within the groups. The results from the two models are similar, which suggests that the simple model is good enough for practical purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. One of the advantages of resampling, compared to mathematical analysis, is that it is easy to compute the sampling distribution of almost any statistic.  As an exercise, you computed the sampling distribution of the coefficient of variation.\n"
