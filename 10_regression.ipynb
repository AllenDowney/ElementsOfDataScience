    "## Limits of single regression\n",
    "\n",
    "In a previous exercise, you made a scatter plot of vegetable consumption as a function of income, and plotted a line of best fit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's what it looks like:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://github.com/AllenDowney/ElementsOfDataScience/raw/master/figs/fig08-01.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The slope of the line is 0.07, which means that the difference between the lowest and highest income brackets is about 0.49 servings per day.\n",
    "\n",
    "So that's not a very big difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "But it was an arbitrary choice to plot vegetables as a function of income.  We could have plotted it the other way around, like this.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://github.com/AllenDowney/ElementsOfDataScience/raw/master/figs/fig08-02.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The slope of this line is about 0.2, which means that the difference between 0 and 10 servings per day is about 2 income levels, roughly from level 5 to level 7.\n",
    "\n",
    "And the difference between income levels 5 and 7 is about $30,000 per year, which is substantial.\n",
    "\n",
    "So if we use vegetable consumption to predict income, we see a big difference.  But when we used income to predict vegetable consumption, we saw a small difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "This example shows that regression is not symmetric; the regression of A onto B is not the same as the regression of B onto A.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see that more clearly by putting the two figures side by side and plotting both regression lines on both figures.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://github.com/AllenDowney/ElementsOfDataScience/raw/master/figs/fig08-03.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "They are different because they are based on different assumptions.  \n",
    "\n",
    "* On the left, we treat income as a known quantity and vegetable consumption as random.\n",
    "\n",
    "* On the right, vegetable consumption is known and income is random.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you run a regression model, you make decisions about how to treat the data, and those decisions affect the results you get.\n",
    "\n",
    "This example is meant to demonstrate another point, which is that regression doesn't tell you much about causation.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you think people with lower income can't afford vegetables, you might look at the figure on the left and conclude that it doesn't make much difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you think better diet increases income, the figure on the right might make you think it does.\n",
    "\n",
    "But in general, regression can't tell you what causes what.  If you see a relationship between any two variables, A and B, the reason for the relationship might be that A causes B, B causes A, or there might be other factors that cause both A and B.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regression alone can't tell you which way it goes.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, we have tools for teasing apart relationships among multiple variables; one of the most important is multiple regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "SciPy doesn't do multiple regression, so we'll to switch to a new library, StatsModels.  Here's the import statement."

This might not be the most exciting part of the process, but if you skip these steps, it can come back to haunt you.  Time spent cleaning and validating data can save you from embarrassing, and sometimes expensive, errors.\n",

    "- Notebook 7 is about exploring variables one at a time, visualizing distributions using PMFs, CDFs, and KDE, and choosing appropriate summary statistics.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Finally, in Notebook 9, we explored multivariate relationships using multiple regression and logistic regression.\n",
    "\n",
