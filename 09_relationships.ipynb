    "A scatter plot is often a good choice when you are exploring a new data set, but it can take some attention to avoid overplotting.\n",
    "Violin and box plot are particularly useful when one of the variables only takes on a few discrete values.\n",

    "And we considered two ways to quantify the strength of a relationship: the coefficient of correlation and the slope of a regression line.\n",
    "These statistics capture different aspect of what we might mean by \"strength\".\n",
    "The coefficient of correlation indicates how well we can predict one variable, given the other.\n",
    "The slope of the regression line indicates how much difference we expect in one variable as we vary the other.\n",
    "One or the other might be more relevant, depending on the context."
