    "\n",
    "The goal of these notebooks is to give you the tools you need to execute a data science project from beginning to end.  We'll start with some basic programming concepts and work our way toward data science tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you already have some programming experience, the first few notebooks might be a little slow.  But there might be some material, specific to data science, that you have not seen before.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have not programmed before, you should expect to face some challenges.  I have done my best to explain everything as we go along; I try not to assume anything.  And there are exercises throughout the notebooks that should help you learn, and remember what you learned.\n",
    "\n",
    "Programming is a super power.  As you learn to program, I hope you feel empowered to take on bigger challenges.  But programming can also be frustrating.  It might take some persistence to get past some rough spots.\n",
    "\n",
    "The topics in this notebook include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Using Jupyter to write and run Python code.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Basic programming features in Python: variables and values.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Translating formulas from math notation to Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Along the way, we'll review a couple of math topics I assume you have seen before, logarithms and algebra."

    "\n",
    "If you select a Code cell, you should see a button on the left with a triangle inside a circle, which is the icon for \"Play\".  If you press this button, Jupyter runs the code in the cell and displays the results.\n",
